It’s great to see Grommet’s momentum building month after month. It was a solid month for contributions with 235 commits and 42 pull requests accepted. Let’s put our virtual hands together for our amazing contributors: [@allisonday](https://github.com/codeswan), [@jackie](https://github.com/jwijay), [@eabay](https://github.com/eabay), [@son](https://github.com/phuson), [@nickvanmeter](https://github.com/nickjvm), [@primozs](https://github.com/primozs), [@alex.mejias](https://github.com/karatechops), [@kentsalcedo](https://github.com/kentsalcedo).

P.S: Sorry about skipping 0.6.0 and 0.6.1. We are still facing intermittent issues on NPM with missing icons. 0.6.2 has been tested and is already being used in production.
