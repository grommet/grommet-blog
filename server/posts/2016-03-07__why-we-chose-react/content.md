As many of you know, technologists are an opinionated bunch and debates on topics like which JavaScript framework is king are never-ending. With that in mind, the rationale I’m about to share describes why we chose to use React in early 2015 over Angular for building Grommet.  I understand I won’t convince everyone. In fact, I’m sure this will cause all sorts of religious reactions. I’m expecting replies countering each point I make with pointers to blogs disproving assertions (yes, I’ve read most of those blogs). The bottom line is we continue to see strong adoption of Grommet based on the React model, and our adopters are providing feedback that affirms the benefits described below.

With that said, we chose React because of the following benefits.  While conducting our investigation, we relied on the experiences and feedback of other adopters. As such, I’ve noted which company pointed out the benefits during our evaluation.  Since our adoption, many other companies have started using React.
