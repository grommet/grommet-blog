In our last podcast we spoke with admitted Canadian and accessibility guru extraordinaire Jennison Asuncion who leads the accessibility efforts at LinkedIn. The whole conversation was really insightful, and if you haven't given it a listen yet, I strongly encourage you to do so. 

I've pulled out three quotes with pointers from Jennison that he urges everyone to keep in mind when looking to make their websites and apps more accessible:

## 1. Don't Forget the Keyboard

"The one tool I think that's going to surprise everyone, the very first I'm going to mention is the keyboard. If you cannot navigate to and operate every focusable element using the keyboard alone, then everything falls apart because a fundamental of accessibility is keyboard operability. 

You also need to be able to see, this is funny coming from a blind person, you need to see actually what you're tabbing, where your focus is. Because there are some in the design community and elsewhere that turn off the focus outline. If you do that, then people with low vision or other people who are keyboard-only users can't see it. You'd also wanted to check to make sure that you're not trapping keyboard focus which is actually not as common anymore.

You also want to make sure that there's a logical tabbing order; left, right, top, bottom. 

Essentially, the keyboard is really important. I want everyone to go to your favorite website now and try and complete a transaction just using the keyboard alone and follow all of those things I just mentioned."

## 2. Consider Color Contrast

"One thing that people don't realize as part of accessibility is making sure that web pages have sufficient foreground and background color contrast. 

There's a bunch of tools if you use your favorite search engine and look up color contrast analyzer. You'll be able to find out whether your site can be read by people with low vision or with people who are color blind. There are a lot of folks who are colorblind out there and they can't read pages because they have poor contrast. 

There's a nice handy Chrome accessibility extension that you can download and it becomes a tab in your developer tools. You can run an audit. One of the neat things you can do is also do a color contrast test with that. It will actually not only show you that something has poor color contrast but it will show you what it looks like if you bump it up properly."

## 3. Use a Screen Reader

"The last thing I'll mention, deliberately last, is using a screen reader. I hesitate because I don't want any developer to just turn on the screen reader and just start. It's a powerful tool. You really need to spend some time learning how to use it properly. I always fear that people are using a screen reader and they might not be using it correctly. They'll report a false positive or they think that there's a problems and there's not. Frankly, you really should talk to a real screen reader user to make sure that if you'll hear something, it might not actually be the correct thing.

Some screen readers are better than others to test with. Certainly, in a Mac, you have voice-over built in and there's a free screen reader for windows called NVDA or nonvisual desktop access."

## Make Your Enterprise Apps Accessible! 

"If someone handed me an app that was built in Grommet and the components weren't rendered to be accessible, I'd be dead in the water. I wouldn't be able to be a productive worker. Whether it's me or someone else with a disability, that's what it ultimately comes down to for enterprise apps. Those are bread and butter apps that people need to be productive and successful in their work. If that's not accessible, then I'm in trouble, plain and simple.

I think if we don't get more developers and designers thinking about accessibility, we do run the risk of creating a much more...you know how we used to have physical barriers? I have a feeling, if we don't all work together, we're going to have more digital barriers. For Folks like myself, it's going to be a lot more difficult."
