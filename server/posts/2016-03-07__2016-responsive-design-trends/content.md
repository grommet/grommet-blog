The Grommet team recently connected with designer and author Ethan Marcotte to talk about responsive design trends for 2016. He coined the term “[responsive web design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)” back in 2010 to describe a new way of designing for the ever-changing Web. We took the opportunity to ask Ethan a few questions on how he got started and where he sees responsive web design going in 2016. Enjoy the insights and comment below with  any additional questions for Ethan.

G: For our audience, it would be great to know a little bit about you, how you became the face of Responsive Web Design (RWD), started writing for A Book Apart, and what you’ve learned as the web continues to change?
E: Sure! I’m an independent designer based in Boston, and first coined the term “responsive web design” in a 2010 conference talk. From there, it turned into an article, and then, a year later, a little yellow book. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting “responsive design” to last much longer than the original article—I’m still shocked, humbled, and excited by how many people have embraced the approach.

And as they have, the discussion about responsive design has gotten much broader and nuanced. It’s embraced issues of design process, of performance, of truly device-agnostic design—heck, even responsive-friendly advertising has entered the fray. Personally, I think it’s an incredibly exciting time to be a responsive designer; I can’t wait to see what happens next.
