Our own Grommet developer, Alan Souza, recently kicked off the Grommet training series with our first tutorial. In it, Alan explains how viewers can get started with Grommet.

By the end of this video you will be able to:

* Install Grommet using Node/NPM
* Create an initial application structure using Grommet CLI
* Create a simple to-do app
* Test Accessibility in your newly created app

Note: This video is intended for viewers with knowledge in Javascript, Node.JS and [React](/post/2016/02/04/why-we-chose-react).
