# grommet-blog

An oddly simple blog implementation for Grommet.

[WIP]: We are still working on the manage aspect of the blog and also figuring out how others can reuse it in a click of a button.

## How To

To run this application, execute the following commands:

  1. Install NPM modules

    ```
    $ cd grommet-blog
    $ npm install
    ```

  2. Start the server

    ```
    $ npm start
    ```

  3. Start the UI development server

    ```
    $ gulp dev
    ```

  4. Build project
  
     ```
    $ npm run build
    ```
